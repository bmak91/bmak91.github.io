I finally decided I was due to buy a gaming console, having relegated my gaming needs to a pc my whole life. And while some purists might consider the transition from pc gaming a downgrade (I still hold that nothing beats a mouse and a keyboard), I didn't exactly have the super-awesome-nitrogen-cooled-star-trek-like-quantum gaming pc to consider this transition as such.

In fact, the last desktop we had was a pentium 3 (with a pentium 4 sticker, mind you) and an I-can't-remember-nor-care-to-check amount of RAM, with a 512M dedicated graphics card maybe?? So my gaming prowess was mostly put to the test on my brother's (then) HP laptop, then on my current rMBP's virtual machine. And while the latter survived CoD: Modern Warfare and the occasional racing game, I don't have the heart to even suggest to it to run any of the new games I set my eyes on.

So naturally my next step was:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I realize this is like asking about the sex of angels, but Xbox One or PS4 (in Lebanon)?</p>&mdash; Bassem Makarem (@makbrain) <a href="https://twitter.com/makbrain/status/530780991942828032">November 7, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And naturally, having no friends, no one responded _(slight exageration)_. But I digress.

What followed was ~~a spiritual journey into the depths of my soul~~ some research on the matter, and below is the reasoning that led me to my (tentative?) final decision.

This being my first console, I don't exactly have the attachment that many have to the different franchises and that would sway me one way or another. It seemed to me though that the xbox offered mainly FPS games (most notably Halo) as exclusives, while the PS4 had more varied genres in the form of Infamous Second Son and The Order: 1886 to support the cross-platform games such as CoD.

On the other hand, the xbox has the clear advantage in (non-gaming) entertainment features (which I _do_ care about, and want). Being a Microsoft fanboy, this convinced me that there was no escaping buying into both platforms at one point, my issue now was deciding which to get first. The factors I considered boiled down to:

- Graphics & Performance: Since there's a consensus that the PS4 is the better one in this area, it seemed better to play most of my games on it and only play the exclusives on the xbox, combined with the hope that Microsoft might refresh it in the meantime to make it slimmer and (long shot, maybe) bridge the gap with the PS4.

- Online services: I'm not sure I can ever trust PSN after their store-info-in-plain-text fiasco 2 years ago, but Microsoft has had even more drama regarding supporting features (not just xbox) outside the US, and frankly ain't nobody got time for that.

- Price: It's already more expensive to buy anything in Lebanon, so I'll hold-on to my Benjamin-Franklin, thank you.

So that's that: I'm getting a PS4. 
Maybe.
