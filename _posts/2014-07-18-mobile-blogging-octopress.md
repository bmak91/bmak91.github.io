I am trying to blog from my phone, as I might need to do that during my trip to Europe in 2 weeks. To write these words, I had to install a 3rd party github app (sgit) because the official app is almost useless.

But then I forgot to add '.md' while naming the file that would become this post, so naturally I had to go to the file manager, rename it, then copy the yaml header from a previous post because who remembers that, then edit the file and write these words.

tl;dr: Octopress might be cool, but it's a pain in the ass. I miss blogger and WordPress.
