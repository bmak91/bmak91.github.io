I read a [recent post](http://saraelyafi.com/2014/06/25/results-of-my-presidential-elections-poll-and-a-plan-of-change/) by Sara El-Yafi discussing an unofficial presidential poll she hosted on her blog, comparing its results to [LBCI's unofficial poll](http://www.president-2014.com/En/), and calling on the electoral body (the Lebanese parliament) to uphold popular opinion on the matter.

In the post, she argues the illegitimacy of the current parliament, and by extension that of the government that earned its vote of confidence (points that I tend to agree with), and advocates direct presidential elections as a solution (a point I aim to contest).

I oppose direct presidential elections in Lebanon. Not because I fear the imbalance in the numbers [of people belonging to different sects]; after all, I am unequivocally against the current sectarian system and a proponent of the establishment of a true secular state. In fact, I do not **fear** it for any reason. I stand opposed to it because it contradicts our current system of governance, namely a parliamentary republic.

In a parliamentary system such as ours, the executive branch is held accountable to the legislature, which itself derives its legitimacy from the people. It is the fact that the parliament elects a president and gives the government a vote of confidence that makes them accountable to it. On the other hand, having the president elected by popular vote short-circuits that, and frees the president from parliamentary oversight, because his legitimacy would then be derived directly from the people as well.

While that may not necessarily be a "bad thing", what follows is that if one wants to advocate direct presidential elections in Lebanon, they **must** first advocate a change to a (semi-)presidential system. Still I would be arguing against such a change. 

Our experience with a parliamentary system in Lebanon has been fraught with political impasse and disregard to our national interest, but it does not taint the principle itself, one successfully implemented in most European countries and elsewhere. A directly elected president is as legitimate as one could get, but in my opinion holds more power than any one person alone should have.

The notion of "checks and balances" was invented for a reason, and I believe a parliamentary system honors it best. A sweeping change of the political class has been way overdue, but our political system is not broken.
