Today, I was called a fandroid! *gasp* Well, not that exact word, but close. For the uninitiated among you, Android is a mobile operating system owned by Google, and is running on a wide variety of Samsung and HTC phones, along with toys branded by LG and Sony-Ericson. But, if you don't already know what Android is, this post is probably not for you :)

I'll start with a disclaimer: my next phone is most likely gonna be a Galaxy Nexus [Prime]. (**Update:** It was an HTC one running sense, then cyanogenmod, then paranoid android.) That said, I really and sincerely believe this is the first Android smartphone worthy of my money. Some may Boo me for not considering the Galaxy SII, but I really, sincerely believe that it was a total iPhone 4/4S rip-off design-wise, and a miserable one for that matter.

Now a few things that trouble me concerning Android:

* Laggy, laggy, and laggy.. did I mention Laggy? The lag most certainly doesn't show on high-end super-powered devices, but God help you if you ever come near one of those mid-range phones. The fact that it needs so much power to run is a point of concern, especially when compared with iOS and Windows Phone, both of which are more than happy to fly on lower specs.Admittedly though, that might well change with Android 4.0 "ICS" now supporting hardware acceleration.

* Roulette-like updates, meaning you're not guaranteed when and if your device gets updated to newer versions, otherwise known as the "F" word (Fragmentation! Seriously, what were you thinking? ) for the Androidophobics out there. That also may not matter much though as long as your device works fine, except for a few features added occasionally.

Not proof enough? I really like the fluidity of iOS on my iPad 2 (I doubt I could stand iOS on a phone though), and the superior build quality of Apple products in general, and am really envious of that iPhone 4S camera. Also, I love the looks and functionality of Windows Phone, and only the lack of proper hardware (yeah, money too :P) stands between me and getting one (Nokia's Lumia 800 is great, but I'm sure a much better handset is on the way). Basically, I love (and hate) all those tech giants, Microsoft included, and am only looking for what's indeed a great product.

Final point: BlackBerry's suck!

**Update:** This post sucks. I am a fandroid.
