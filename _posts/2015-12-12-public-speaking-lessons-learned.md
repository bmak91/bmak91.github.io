A few days ago, I had the opportunity to speak about developing cross-platform mobile apps with Xamarin, as part of Microsoft’s TechDays event in Beirut. It was my first public speech ever, and below is what I took away from the whole experience.

## Things *will* go wrong.
They only had a VGA connector to the screen, so I had to forgo of my MBP and the iOS demo<sup>[1]</sup> I had prepared, and use a different laptop  that a Microsoftie kindly lent me. (Building a Xamarin app for iOS requires a mac, so I had to demo instead on Android, which wasn’t as fresh in my memory)

## Your audience is kinder than you might think
It’s stressing to talk to a crowd, more so when it’s your first time. I’d say my comfort level was fluctuating, at times I’d gain courage and answer questions confidently, then I’d stress out and take a few seconds to recollect my thoughts. But when I was panicking about writing that freaking List Adapter at the end, an audience member did come to me and offer help. It was a lost cause at that point, but I appreciated the gesture nonetheless. Some interactions after the session was over also helped raise my spirits.

## Four days of preparation are not enough
I was speaking because the original speaker couldn’t make it, so I only had 4 days to prepare. I thought that was enough. I was wrong. (I could’ve reviewed the Android APIs, which I hadn’t used for a few months now)

## Live coding is the worst.
*see above*

## Don’t get discouraged
I was excited about the opportunity to speak, but I had my expectations in check (should’ve lowered them even more :P). But I recognise what was my fault and what was out of my hands, so I’ll work on the former, and practise to handle the latter better. This is meant to be an encouragement to anyone who’s had a less than stellar first experience, or who’s yet to give a public talk and perhaps frets it. You’re bound to fall, and you’re bound to get up again, and frankly I doubt anyone will remember when a few months had passed. 

Unless of course you blog about it, that is.



[1] I know it’s a talk about cross-platform development, but after doing a basic cross platform demo, I wanted to do something that’s a bit more than another TODO app. And given the time constraints, I figured it’s better to delve a bit deeper on one platform than cover only light topics on all three. The concepts would still apply for the other two.
