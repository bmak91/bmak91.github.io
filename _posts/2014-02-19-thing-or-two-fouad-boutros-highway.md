I don't live in Ashrafiyeh. I'm not really attached to it. In fact, the only places I've passed through in Ashrafiyeh are Sassine Square and the Highway from Spinney's to Bayt Al-Tabib, perhaps a few narrow streets that my cab detoured to- and that I couldn't remember to save my life- as well. Sure I've been to ABC, but a mall is hardly a way to get to know a city. I may lean with my political views towards the party behind the current Beirut Municipality, I may lean with my economics views against it. And I don't even vote in Beirut. But that doesn't matter.

Sometimes before the Lebanese civil war, there was a proposal to build a highway/bridge connecting 2 spots in Ashrafiyeh that I can't pinpoint on a map. It promised to ease traffic and the flow of people in-and-out of Beirut. The project was put on hold for years on end, and only recently has it resurfaced. Because what better way to develop a city than to drop a highway on it from a time capsule.

Paris, Seoul, Boston, Toronto, Seattle, San Francisco \*, and very likely other cities as well. What they have in common is an urban planning policy they implemented known as Freeway Removal. The gist of it is that a highway, thought to be vital for a city, was found after decades of studies to be detrimental for it, prompting its removal. Each of these cities had a highway that was considered to cut through the fabric of their societies, making the neighborhoods surrounding it unaccessible to pedestrians, driving unecessary traffic into residential zones, and depreciating the land value of its surroundings. And each of these highways was replaced with a boulevard accessible to pedestrians, some with a bicycle lane, in addition to parks and public places for families to enjoy. And to think that the Beirut municipality plans on removing a park (Jesuite) to make way for this project.

You may not care about pedestrian accessibility, but think about this: what are the most beautiful cities you've been to or wished to visit? London, Prague, Budapest, Vienna, Amsterdam, Barcelona, hell, even downtown Beirut. You may not realize it, but you couldn't have enjoyed any of these if you had to stay in a car while passing through. And when you're able to walk or bike- safely- in a city, you learn to forgo of your car, which tends to drive traffic not up, but down. Moreover, having parks and shops easily accessible raises the real estate value of a land, so economic benefits are readily apparent.

Ultimately, the deciding factors boil down to two, and two only:

- First, as in any democracy, the people directly affected by the project, the local residents, MUST be heard.
- Second, urban planning studies must be backed up by facts, facts other cities had gathered over decades.

Here's to dreaming of a better Beirut, one truly bustling with life.

**A protest will be held on Sunday February 23rd against the project and its catastrophic effects starting 11am at Rmeil area near the Maronite Archbishopric of Ashrafieh. [More info here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1466099320273252/?ref=22 "Facebook Event").**
