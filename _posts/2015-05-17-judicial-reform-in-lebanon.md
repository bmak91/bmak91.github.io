# Judicial Reform in Lebanon
I’ve had a clear framework for judicial reform in Lebanon in my head for a while, and the last Samaha ruling creates the perfect opportunity to lay it out. I consider the following so important that it will impact my decision on who to vote for in the next elections based on candidates’ stance from it, and I urge you to do the same.

Outside of the politics of it all, my proposals are rooted in concepts of human rights and decency that protect against police brutality, judicial overreach, and infringement of civil rights. Most of the following is not new and is in some form or another widely applied in countries where human rights are held in high esteem, and it is my opinion that they should be applied in Lebanon as well.

## Right to an attorney present at all times
The current laws allow (if not require) interrogations to happen without an attorney present, which in turn makes way for police brutality and forced confessions. An attorney alone does not guarantee due process (see later points), but it goes a long way.

## Right against self-incrimination
The US constitution’s 5th amendment protects, among other things, a person from being compelled to incriminate themselves, by “answer[ing] questions or otherwise give testimony against himself or herself”. This concept should be applied universally, as it compels police to produce hard incriminating evidence, instead of always relying on confessions. 

A careful analysis of our current laws- based on the civil law system (*jus civile*, as opposed to common law)- where in the interest of justice and fairness, a prosecutor is required to disclose even exonerating evidence and recommend acquittal even if a (false) confession is obtained, shows that simply relying on confessions does not serve the law, and that police is always required to collect evidence separately. The right against self-incrimination provides additional motive for the police to do their job.

## Due Process and Police Interrogations
Complimentary to the previous points, police interrogations should happen in a room with a continuous video record. Any interruptions to the video feed should be grounds for dismissal. Any evidence produced outside of this room should be inadmissible in court. This guarantees that police conduct proper interrogations under the threat of their case being dismissed by the court, and protects the suspect- who lest we forget is innocent until proven otherwise- from unnecessary bodily harm.

In addition, preventive custody should be time limited in all cases (maximum of 48 hours before standing in front of the investigative judge for the first time, maximum of 6 months while awaiting trial), which would protect against trumped up charges, and form an incentive for faster trials.

## Revisit of the criminal code
Of particular interest is the libel crime which should be reclassified under civil code, with punishment limited to monetary restitutions and never incarceration. This is essential to any community that values freedom of speech.

## Revisit of the court system
The main talk currently is about limiting the jurisdiction of the military court to disciplinary action against members of the military exclusively, which I believe is overdue regardless of any one sentence. 

That is not the only court that needs to be scrapped however, as the single level judicial council remains in defiance of a right to appeals, with its sentences binding and irrevocable (not subject to appeal). Its absurdity was best shown when a Palestinian by the name of Youssef Mahmoud Chaabane was convicted of murdering a Jordanian diplomat (Naëb Omran al-Maaitha) and could not be retried and released despite his innocence after the actual perpetrators were later convicted and executed in Jordan<sup>1</sup>.

## Bonus Round: Capital Punishment
The capital punishment (death penalty) is in my opinion inhumane and should be abolished in Lebanese law.
