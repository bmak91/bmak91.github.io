So some friends have been asking me about a tweet I made regarding issuing a new Lebanese passport that I thought it'd be better to write it in a post, as it'll be easier for everyone to see.

For a primer, read the [following post](http://stateofmind13.com/2016/01/06/everything-you-need-to). In short, Lebanese General Security suddenly decided to cancel some types of passports to comply with ICAO regulations, which left many Lebanese confused about their travel plans. The decision comes into effect on January 10th.

Unfortunately for those who would have to reissue new passports, our passports are still not equipped with the emv chip that should hold the biometric information in compliance with, you guessed it, ICAO regulations <sup>[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport)</sup>. This leaves many with the very real prospect of having to reissue yet another passport once those (passports with emv chips) become available around July <sup>[source](http://www.lecommercedulevant.com/node/24547)</sup> of this year.

I for one am planning a vacation abroad in the summer and need to issue a new passport instead of my expired one. I would have to issue it around May if I am to apply for Visas in time, which would mean I would still be getting the old (non-emv) type. Since those will probably cease to be valid in less than 5 years, it wouldn't make sense for me to get the one with the 5 years validity, so the one-year passport makes more sense, especially with the prices we have to pay for one.

This also of course annoys some people who like to have all their visas on the same passport, and considering most embassies ask for previous passports to check if the applicant overstayed their visa, that would end up annoying almost anyone wanting to travel.

Perks of being a Lebanese.
