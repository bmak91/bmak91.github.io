As customs go with every launching of a new project, one has to give an eloquent speech as to what it means for him to have reached where he presently has, what sacrifices he may have made, and the prospects and hopes that his new journey may hold. It also goes without saying the necessity of including such grandiose and sophisticated (and awesome :P) words as paramount, behold, pledge and behemoth, words that I must resist the temptation of using in my posts, for they tend to suck me in a vicious cycle that usually instigates me to write full paragraphs  of complicated syntax, and that more often than not turn out to be of utmost crap.. or should I say paltriness?

**Update:** This post was obviously supposed to be the first to be published along with the blog launch. However, with the news of Apple's new iPhone 4S announcement, I had to publish a [pre-launch post](/why-apple-went-with-4s/ "Why Apple went with the 4S") covering it.

Now with all seriousness, this blog will start off by being a general, personal one relaying my thoughts on the many things we encounter in life, though I have in my mind plans to later spin off the tech related parts into a dedicated blog of their own, depending on my time and on how much of a success this blog would turn out to be. It will therefore focus more on my opinions (educated as they are :P) on news and not on bringing these news; other sites and blogs are already doing the latter perfectly. The issues discussed will vary from the "light" ones to hopefully others that are of more seriousness and are more thought provocative or maybe even controversial.

As this is my first serious attempt at blogging, it is a no-brainer that it will take me some time to find a tone of my own to use, especially that talking to a screen is not the same as talking to human beings, and might actually turn one mad in the process :P. You should be expecting at least one new post per week, but I will definitely try my best to deliver more.

I'll cut the blabber short, and hopefully you'll enjoy this ride as much as I will. (Oh and don't shy out from checking my "About" page)

Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
Also, deranged! :P

*P.S. The title is not missing an "n", rather I used what I believe to be the Latin version of the word.. Just because..*
