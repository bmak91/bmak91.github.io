I read a [great post](http://stateofmind13.com/2015/06/06/the-ella-tannous-case-when-every-lebanese-suddenly-become-a-doctor/) tackling the issue of accountability of doctors in Lebanon, explaining the medical events that led to the unfortunate amputation of an infant's hand, and criticising the sensationalism of the media's handling of the case and the subsequent arrest of the doctor involved without a fair and sensible trial.
 
I believe that a judgement can't be made without a proper background knowledge of the elements making the case at hand; A layperson judging something like a dress design might pass as reasonable (fashion being both subjective and with fairly mild consequences if you get it wrong), but one definitely can't discuss medical issues, the knowledge of which takes years of learning, with the same nonchalance. I also find the medical explanation satisfying my humble knowledge of biology, gained during 3 years of studying it in college; but even if it didn't that really isn't what this post is about. And don't even get me started on the state of the media and journalism (in all its forms really) in Lebanon. But all that has been restating what was in the linked post. 
 
What I'd like you to consider, if you'll indulge me, is how a society should go about fighting corruption in an "organised" (as in having a syndicate ordained by law, or anything similar) field like in this case medicine (**without** the implied notion that corruption is indeed present), and ensuring accountability of the people in that field.
 
## Who watches the watchers?
 
The aforementioned article posits, summarised in a sentence, that only doctors should be allowed to judge doctors. "Only doctors can know when medical errors occur. Only doctors can judge another doctor who does a medical error.", it says. This statement, while true to a great length, has the following implications.
 
Should corruption reach a level where a majority of the governing body (in this case the syndicate) are complicit, it becomes near impossible not only to fight it, but to prove it exists in the first place. Whether for fear of retaliation, or for going with the mantra of "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours", if no one admits to wrongdoing, how can you try a crime that never happened?
 
The second implication is that part of the society has become above the latter's governing laws, not accountable to anyone, creating inequality amongst its members and causing it to become dysfunctional. The disruption is effected at the heart of the social contract, where a part holds much more power than possibly the rest combined, bringing about devastating results on the fabric of the community. It is therefore essential to find a balance between the first principle, that of the need to be knowledgeable to be able to judge, and the need to maintain the balance of checks and accountability, ideally without compromising either.
 
## The real role of the media
 
Enters what the media should be doing, but isn't. Journalists are all about informing the public, and empowering them to make educated decisions on matters that they may not be particularly experts on. Politics, or *politikos*, which originally meant managing and catering to people['s needs], is a prime example. We readily accept that the public should have a say in how a whole country should be managed (at least for those believing in democracy), and we do that through voting. We indirectly decide what a country's fiscal plan should be for example, and yet few of us actually understand the true depth of economics and finance. I'd argue that the scale of politics' impact makes it even more serious than medicine, even if it might not seem that way. Clearly we're fine with laymen judging that.
 
And the reason for that is that some people have devoted themselves to make us aware of the various policies proposed by politicians and their various implications, going into the details of what we might not have time, or are reluctant to dive into ourselves, and giving us the "tl;dr", if you will, to allow us to make a proper judgement. And the weight we give to the journalists' summaries are directly affected by their experience, their lack of conflict of interest, and their track record. Unfortunately the latter isn't working quite well for Lebanese media.
 
## What can be done
 
A third part of a healthy accountability system lies in the hands of the Order of Physicians itself. I think that a clear outline of what constitutes grounds for malpractice or negligence by physicians and which would apply to all future cases (one hopes they'd be few) could go a long way in improving transparency and increasing public trust, which seems lacking now, in the practice as a whole.
 
To reiterate, knowledge of the issue at hand is essential before being able to cast judgements, and this can't be stressed enough. Self-regulating, however, offers little insurances of transparency and accountability, and protections against corruption, and needs to remain debatable by a knowledgeable, and responsible public aided by the media. And finally, a better commitment to due process by us all would go a long way in setting this country back on the right tracks.
